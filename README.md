## Description
This project is a practical conference item of my React Native mobile app series that made with:
 - react native v0.66.1
 - [react-native-testing-library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library) - (to make unit testing with jest and more)
 - [react-hooks-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library) - (complete React hooks testing utilities)
 - [react-native-elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) - (UI Toolkit for RN apps)
 - [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) - (UI buttons and logos)
   
 - Of course, I used things like custom hooks, components, screens and unit testing over screens and hooks.
